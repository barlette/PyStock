# PyStock
Very simple email-based stock market tracker.

It consists of a configurable stock market tracker which will get stock information from Yahoo Finance and deliver from your email to a list of recipients the stock information.

The list of stocks to be tracked can be configured as well the sender and recipients email.

TODO:
	- Configure at which time of the day or which interval to execute the python script
	- Add an invested sum as one of the tracking variables
